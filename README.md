# âš½ FoosBoard 
This is an express module that I created for tracking foosball games while I was working at McAfee on the WebAdvisor team

The application connected to a Firebase DB which would store player and game data. Users would interact with the program using slash commands to record 1v1 and 2v2 games or view the current stats and standings.

I left it mid-development and have since lost interest, so it's not working anymore. But it was fun while it lasted!
